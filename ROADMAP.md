# Chrome Cookie Retriever Project Roadmap

## Project Timeline

### Initial Setup and Core Implementation
1. Project initialization with CMake and vcpkg
2. Basic project structure setup
3. Implementation of core classes:
   - `WebhookSender`: Discord webhook communication
   - `ChromeCookieRetriever`: Cookie extraction and decryption

### Development Iterations

#### Build 1: Basic Structure
- Initial CMake configuration
- Basic file structure
- Core class declarations
- First compilation attempt (Failed due to missing dependencies)

#### Build 2: Dependency Integration
- Added vcpkg integration
- Configured required libraries:
  - libcurl
  - SQLite3
  - nlohmann/json
- Second compilation attempt (Failed due to linking errors)

#### Build 3: Header Fixes
- Added missing headers
- Fixed include order
- Resolved namespace conflicts
- Third compilation attempt (Failed due to std::min ambiguity)

#### Build 4: Compilation Success
- Fixed std::min namespace issues
- Added missing algorithm headers
- Successfully compiled the program
- First working build achieved

#### Build 5: Current State
- Successfully builds and runs
- Can access Chrome cookie database
- Identifies 45 cookies from Google services
- Currently facing two main issues:
  1. Cookie decryption errors (Error code 13)
  2. Webhook sending failures

## Current Features

### Implemented
1. Multi-profile cookie retrieval
2. Support for multiple cookie encryption versions
3. Windows CryptoAPI integration
4. Discord webhook integration
5. Chunked message sending
6. Rate limiting support
7. JSON payload formatting
8. Database backup functionality

### In Progress
1. Cookie decryption improvements
2. Webhook sending reliability
3. Error handling enhancements

## Known Issues

### Critical
1. Legacy cookie decryption failing (Error 13)
2. Webhook sending unreliable
3. Database locking issues with Chrome

### Minor
1. Limited cross-platform support
2. No configuration file
3. Basic error reporting

## Future Roadmap

### Short-term Goals
1. Fix cookie decryption issues
   - Investigate Error 13 causes
   - Implement new decryption methods
   - Add support for latest Chrome versions

2. Improve webhook functionality
   - Better error handling
   - Retry mechanism
   - Size limit handling
   - Rate limit compliance

3. Enhanced Error Handling
   - Detailed error messages
   - Logging system
   - Recovery mechanisms

### Medium-term Goals
1. Cross-platform Support
   - Linux support
   - macOS support
   - Platform-specific encryption handling

2. Configuration System
   - JSON/YAML config file
   - Command-line arguments
   - Profile selection

3. Performance Optimization
   - Batch processing
   - Async operations
   - Memory usage optimization

### Long-term Goals
1. Browser Support
   - Firefox support
   - Edge support
   - Opera support

2. Security Enhancements
   - Secure storage
   - Encryption options
   - Access control

3. User Interface
   - CLI improvements
   - Potential GUI
   - Progress indicators

## Technical Debt

1. Need more comprehensive error handling
2. Better separation of concerns
3. More extensive documentation
4. Unit tests implementation

### Architecture
1. More modular design
2. Plugin system for browsers
3. Better configuration management
4. Improved resource handling
